Let's begin with a disclaimer about the horrors you may witness here:
> The project was not built with TDD in mind from the beginning because I had no idea how it would turn out, and TDD is all about testing against specifications beforehand. First, I needed to ensure that the concept worked as intended. Once that was out of the way, I refined the design, refactoring everything iteratively. After making sure that the design was mature enough and would not require major changes in the long run, I was ready to rewrite it using a [TDD approach](https://github.com/b-weise/aittd-otdd).
